# Flashbapp

> This was once our [AngularAttack](https://www.angularattack.com) 2016 project

Create a flash on a place with a date and description of
what happened there and share it with people around the world.

### Step 1) Understand what is this

This is an Angular 2 project and your looking at the `master` branch.
Right here you cannot make any deploy, for that you have the `webpack` branch.
The status is a working Alpha application waiting to be developed.

### Step 2) Get Your Local Environment setup

Clone this repo locally

* Install the latest [Node / NPM](https://nodejs.org).

* `git clone git@github.com:hardcoffee/flashbapp.git`

* `cd flashbapp`

* `npm install`

* `npm start` will start the server locally to test that everything is running correctly


### Step 2) Deploy App

Not possible. This is not prepared to be deployed.

### Step 3) Happy coding

    console.log('start typing!');
